# EXAMPLE 1:
User Query: "Which airport is located in Maine, Sacramento International Airport or Knox County Regional Airport?"

This is a two-part question. First, I need to identify the company Peter Hobbs founded. Second, I need to find the specific location of that company's base, focusing on towns within Manchester.
List:
1. company founded by Peter Hobbs

# EXAMPLE 3:
