For a consistent recursively axiomatized theory T, one can prove in finitistic arithmetic that the well-foundedness of a certain transfinite ordinal implies the consistency of T. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem implies that the well-foundedness of such an ordinal cannot be proved in the theory T. Consequences of ordinal analysis include (1) consistency of subsystems of classical second order arithmetic and set theory relative to constructive theories, (2) combinatorial independence results, and (3) classifications of provably total recursive functions and provably well-founded ordinals. Ordinal analysis was originated by Gentzen, who proved\n\n\"Dmitry Mirimanoff\"\nLydia remained there. Dmitry Mirimanoff became a Swiss citizen on 17 September 1926.
