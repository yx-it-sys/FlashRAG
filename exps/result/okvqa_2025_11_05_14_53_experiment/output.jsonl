It could only be used by having the person sit underneath it. Armenian American inventor Gabriel Kazanjian was the first to patent a blow dryer in the United States, in 1911. Around 1915, hair dryers began to go on the market in handheld form. This was due to innovations by National Stamping and Electricworks under the white cross brand, and later U.S. Racine Universal Motor Company and the Hamilton Beach Co., which allowed the dryer to be small enough to be held by hand.

Blow dryers enable better control over the shape and style of hair, by accelerating and controlling the formation of temporary hydrogen bonds within each strand. These bonds are powerful (allowing stronger hair shaping than the sulfur bonds formed by permanent waving products) but are temporary and extremely vulnerable to humidity. They disappear with a single washing of the hair. Hairstyles using blow dryers usually have volume and discipline,\n\n\"Hair dryer\"\nof blow dryers (hair dryers): the handheld and the rigid-hood dryer. A hood dryer has a hard plastic dome that fits over a person's head to dry their hair. Hot air is blown out through tiny openings around the inside of the dome so the hair is dried evenly. Hood dryers are mainly found in hair salons. In 1890 the first hairdryer was invented by French stylist Fay Godefroy. His invention was a large, seated version that consisted of a bonnet that attached to the chimney pipe of a gas stove.
