Nearly all professional bassoonists will perform the piece at some stage in their career, and it is probably the most commonly requested piece in orchestral auditions – it is usually requested that the player perform excerpts from the concerto's first two movements in every audition.

Black on Both Sides Black on Both Sides is the debut studio album by American rapper Mos Def, released on October 12, 1999 by Rawkus and Priority Records. Prior to its recording, Mos Def had collaborated with Talib Kweli for the album \"\"Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star\"\" in 1998, which raised high expectations for a solo effort by the former. \"\"Black on Both Sides\"\" features an emphasis on live instrumentation and socially conscious lyrics. On February 2, 2000, the album was certified Gold in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),\n\n\"Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star\"\nMos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star (often called simply Black Star) is the only studio album by Black Star, a hip hop duo consisting of emcees Talib Kweli and Mos Def (the latter of whom now goes by Yasiin Bey). The album was released on September 29, 1998, to critical acclaim. The title is a reference to the Black Star Line, a shipping line founded by Pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey. The album deals with modern-day issues, philosophical ideas, and life in Brooklyn, New York City, as the two artists know it.\n\n\"Mos Def discography\"\nMedia, run by Mos Def's brother and fellow group member DCQ. The album featured a compilation of previously unreleased and re-released tracks recorded during the original UTD run. Mos Def's third solo album, \"\"Tru3 Magic\"\", was released in 2006 to very little hype. Its single \"\"Undeniable\"\" charted only on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles Sales chart but was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 2007. Mos Def's fourth solo album \"\"The Ecstatic\"\" was released in 2009 on Downtown Records with distribution by Universal Records.
